## Questions & Answers

### Q: "Why not use ChatGPT/GPT-4 for resume generation?"
**A**: "Great question! We focused on accessibility first. GPT-4:
- Costs money (API fees)
- Needs internet
- Raises privacy concerns
- Overkill for structured data collection

Our conversational flow is perfect for this use case - simple, predictable, and FREE."

### Q: "How do you handle different resume formats?"
**A**: "We use ATS-friendly format - the standard format that Applicant Tracking Systems scan. It's clean, keyword-optimized, and works for all industries. Future versions can have industry-specific templates."

### Q: "What about users without smartphones?"
**A**: "Great point! This works on:
- Smartphones (main use case)
- Cyber cafes (common in India)
- NGO centers that help workers
- Any device with a browser

Data saves locally, so they can come back anytime."

### Q: "How accurate is voice recognition for Indian accents?"
**A**: "Web Speech API is trained on diverse accents. In testing:
- Hindi voice input: 85-90% accurate
- English with Indian accent: 80-85%
- Users can edit text if recognition fails
- For illiterate users, helper can type

It's not perfect, but it's FREE and works offline."

### Q: "Why browser TTS instead of Google Cloud TTS?"
**A**: "Practical decision! Google Cloud TTS requires billing setup even for free tier. We hit that blocker during development. Browser TTS:
- 100% free
- No setup
- Works offline
- Privacy preserved
- Quality is good (Google/Microsoft voices when available)

Perfect example of choosing 'good enough and accessible' over 'perfect but blocked'."

### Q: "How do you plan to monetize?"
**A**: "This is 100% free and open source. Potential revenue models:
- Premium templates (optional)
- Job board integration
- Training centers can white-label
- NGO partnerships

But core functionality stays FREE forever."
